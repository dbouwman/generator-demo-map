# generator-demo-map 

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### Install Generator


```
$ npm install -g generator-demo-map
```

### Generate a Demo Map

Create a folder, cd into it, an initiate the generator:

```
$ yo demo-map
```

You will be asked two questions:

- what is the name of this application?
- what is your name? (for package.json) 

Provide answers and Yeoman will scaffold out the demo app for you. Once complete, start things up with

```
grunt
```

This will start a grunt server and open your default browser to index.html. Live-Reload is also running, so you can open up index.html or app.js in your favourite editor, make changes and save them, and the page will be re-loaded automagically.
